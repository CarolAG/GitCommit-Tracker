# Contact Book!

We're going to be building an addressbook application using angular Ã¥ la google contacts.
You should see a lit of contacts with their first and last names, phone numbers and emails.
You be able to add new contacts!

This should be on the home page. Additionally we should also have  alink to a second page that displays information about you that we will  eventually get from an external API, for now just mock it up :o)


This is going to involve a few key steps.
* using the controlller you've been giving, checking out some angular **directives**, for the action that you want and getting the functionality to work
* taking a look at the code I've given you and reading the comments and figuring out whats happening

Electives:
* **angular-material** is installed in the `package.json` and the stylesheet is loaded, do a little research on the different directives it gives you and try to use some of them


# Running the code!

* `npm install` to install all the dependencies
* `grunt`
* open your browser to `localhost:8080`

#Keep all your angular code in the `app/` folder, remember we've got browserify running
