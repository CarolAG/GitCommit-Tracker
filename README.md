# Angular

##Summary

We're going to be building an address book application using angular Ã¥ la google contacts.
You should see a list of contacts with their first and last names, phone numbers, and emails.
You should be able to add new contacts!

This should be on the home page; additionally, we should also have a link to a second page that displays information about you that we will eventually get from an external API. For now just mock it up and write it inline in the controller.


This is going to involve a few key steps:
* Using the controller you've been given, checking out some angular **directives**, for the action that you want and getting the functionality to work
* Taking a look at the code I've given you, plus reading the comments and figuring out what's happening
* I've got an npm module `partialify` running too if you look at how I source the `home` html

Electives:
* **angular-material** is installed in the `package.json` and the stylesheet is loaded; do a little research on the different directives it gives you and try to use some of them.

##Learning Goals

###What is Angular

##Getting started

###Setup

* `npm install` to install all the dependencies
* `bower install` to install other dependencies
<<<<<<< HEAD


* `gulp`

* `npm start`
>>>>>>> e0b7c925c909ca63029e2f00bedffc5c90520909
* open your browser to `localhost:8080`
* I have tests built for this! Open up the `test.html` page to see the results of the test.


#Keep all your angular code in the `app/` folder and remember that we've got browserify running
